# 🏋️‍♂️ PoseTrack — AI Workout Tracker

PoseTrack is a fitness app that runs in your browser and tracks your exercises using your computer or phone camera. It uses artificial intelligence to recognize your body movements and count your workout reps in real time — no equipment or login needed.

## ✨ What It Can Do

- Tracks your body movements live through your webcam
- Recognizes exercises using AI trained on workout videos
- Counts your repetitions automatically
- Works fully in the browser — no need to download anything

## 🛠 How It Works

This app is powered by TensorFlow (a machine learning library) and MediaPipe (a tool that tracks body poses). It watches how your body moves, compares it to known actions, and identifies what you're doing.

## 🚀 How to Use It

1. Click the green "Code" button on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/lathifshaik/Workout) and download the project.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Allow camera access when it asks.
4. Start your workout — it will recognize and count your movements!

> 💡 Tip: Use it in a well-lit room so your body is visible on camera.

## 🔮 Future Ideas

- Add more workout types (like jumping jacks or squats)
- Show a history of your workouts
- Add voice feedback for encouragement
